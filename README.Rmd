# MLFDR

## Overview

The package mediation implements MLFDR, a local-FDR based solution to the high dimensional mediation analysis problem. For $H_{0i} = \alpha_i\beta_i = 0$,  $\alpha_i$ denotes the coefficient of the mediator-exposure relationship, and $\beta_i$, that of the mediator-outcome relationship. MLFDR takes the estimates and standard errors of $\alpha_i$ and $\beta_i$ and fits a Gaussian Mixture model accounting for the composite null hypothesis, and estimates a localFDR based on this Gaussian Mixture model. An adaptive procedure determines the cutoff for the local FDR.

## Installation

You can install the development version of mediation from [GitHub](https://github.com/asmita112358/mediation) with:
```{r}
devtools::install_github("asmita112358/mediation")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which demonstrates the implementation of MLFDR. For more in-depth examples, please refer to the results_in_paper as well as (https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13933).
